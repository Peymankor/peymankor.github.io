  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD Fellow in the <a href = "https://www.uis.no/en">Department of Energy Resources</a> 
    at the University of Stavanger. I am meber of the <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Decision and Data Analytics</a> 
    reasearch group at the University of Stavanger. My current research is focused on:
    <br/>
    **Multi-Stage Learning and Decision Making â€“ "What is the Optimal Time to Invest in New Technology?"**, advised by
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Reidar Brumer Bratvold</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Remus Hena</a>. 
More generally, my research objectives emphasize the development of user-friendly, statistically sound, and open-source software that addresses practical scientific challenges and empowers non-statisticians/data scientists to work more directly with their data.
    My research is supported by an 
<a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Outside of research, I prioritize statistics education and initiatives related to equity.
My teaching objectives emphasize undergraduate statistics education and teaching statistical literacy and best practices to non-statisticians.
Inside and outside of my teaching, I actively try to leverage my position to advocate for and work towards building more equitable communities and cultures within statistics, as well as STEM and academia more broadly, at all levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I was an undergraduate at <a href = " https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a> 
    where I received degrees in statistics and economics.
