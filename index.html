  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> 
    at the University of Washington. My research is focused on model development for compositional data applied to the
    microbiome, advised by 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I was an undergraduate at <a href = " https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a> 
    where I received degrees in statistics and economics. <br/>
    <br/>
This website is currently under construction as I struggle to learn the basics of web development.
