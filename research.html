  <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I am passionate about the development of user-friendly, statistically sound, and open-source software that addresses practical scientific challenges and empowers non-statisticians/data scientists to work more directly with their data.
  If you are interested in collaboration, I welcome you to <a class = "active" href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</h4>

<h4>Statistical Modeling of the Microbiome</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a> to develop methods for proper statistical analysis of the microbiome. 
  I am the developer of corncob, a regression model and hypothesis testing procedure developed 
  to address the challenges of microbiome data, implemented as an R software package. Our proposal uses observed absolute abundance information to 
  make inference about the latent microbial population. The method is published in <i>Annals of Applied Statistics</i>
  (available <a href = "https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1587002666">here</a>) and the software is available 
  <a href = "https://github.com/bryandmartin/corncob">here</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  I have also worked on DivNet, 
  a method for estimating alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities when taxa interact via an ecological network.
  The method is accepted to appear in <i>Biostatistics</i> (currently available <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/21/305045">here</a>) and
  the software is available <a href = "https://github.com/adw96/DivNet">here</a>.

<h4>Small-Area Spatio-temporal Modeling</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I also work on developing spatio-temporal models for under-five mortality estimation with complex survey data 
  with a group led by  <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a> and  
  <a href = "https://sociology.osu.edu/people/clark.2962">Sam Clark</a>. The method is published in PLoS One (available <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210645">here</a>) and our software, SUMMER, is available on CRAN <a href = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SUMMER">here</a>.
