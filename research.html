  <p class = "lead"><small>My research is focused on the question of "What is the Optimal Time to Invest in New Technology", the study requires the formulation of a 
    dynamic programming model. I deeply value interdisciplinary collaboration, and welcome you to <a class = "active" href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you are interested. 
    You can find detailed information about my publications, software, and other work on <a class="active" href="cv.html">my CV</a>.</small></p>

<h4 style="margin-top:0">Multi-Stage Learning and Decision Making</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "http://www.reidar-bratvold.com/">Reidar Brumer Bratvold</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Remus Hanea</a> on the question of "What is the Optimal Time to Invest in New Technology". 
  The goal is to develop a formulation for dynamic programming model where, in each period, the consumer adopts or rejects a new technology or 
  waits and gathers additional information about the benefits of a technology by observing a signal/proof of the technologyâ€™s benefit.

<h4>Small-Area Spatio-temporal Modeling</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I also work on developing spatio-temporal models for under-five mortality estimation with complex survey data 
  with a group led by  <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a> and  
  <a href = "https://sociology.osu.edu/people/clark.2962">Sam Clark</a>. The method is published in PLoS One (available <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210645">here</a>) and our software, SUMMER, is available on CRAN <a href = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SUMMER">here</a>.
