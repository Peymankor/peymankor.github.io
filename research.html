  <p class = "lead"><small>My research is focused on the question of "What is the Optimal Time to Invest in New Technology", the study requires the formulation of a 
    dynamic programming model. I deeply value interdisciplinary collaboration, and welcome you to <a class = "active" href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you are interested. 
    You can find detailed information about my publications, software, and other work on <a class="active" href="cv.html">my CV</a>.</small></p>

  I work with <a href = "http://www.reidar-bratvold.com/">Reidar Brumer Bratvold</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Remus Hanea</a> on the question of "What is the Optimal Time to Invest in New Technology". 
  The goal is to develop a formulation for dynamic programming model where, in each period, the consumer adopts or rejects a new technology or 
  waits and gathers additional information about the benefits of a technology by observing a signal/proof of the technologyâ€™s benefit.

  I also work on developing apps (shinyapps) in the areas of the probabilistic modeling of spaatial data. The links for the two examples are:
