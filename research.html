<h4>Statistical Modeling of the Microbiome</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a> to develop methods for proper statistical analysis of the microbiome. 
  My current focus is the development of CORNCOB, a regression model and hypothesis testing procedure developed 
  to address the challenges of microbiome data. Our proposal uses observed absolute abundance information to 
  make inference about the latent microbial population. The manuscript and software will be made public soon, 
  but in the meantime you can <a class="active" href="contact.html">contact me</a> to learn more. <br/>
  <br/>
  I have also been working on <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/21/305045">DivNet</a>, 
  a method for estimating alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities when taxa interact via an ecological network.
  The software for implementing DivNet is available <a href = "https://github.com/adw96/DivNet">here</a>.

<h4>Small-Area Spatio-temporal Modeling</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I also work on developing spatio-temporal models for under-five mortality estimation with complex survey data 
  with a group led by  <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a> and  
  <a href = "https://sociology.osu.edu/people/clark.2962">Sam Clark</a>. 
  
  You can read more information about our group, including group members, publications, and software,
  on <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/u5mr.html">our webpage</a>. <br/>
  Check out our R package on CRAN, <a href = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SUMMER">SUMMER</a>, 
  for all your spatio-temporal modelling with complex survey data needs!
